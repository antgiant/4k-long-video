# Long Video HEVC Plug-in for RICOH THETA

Records 4K video with a maximum length of 1 hour 24 minutes. 
It overcomes the 25 minute video limitation of the standard THETA V.

This plug-in  uses HEVC, not the default H.264.

To view the video on Windows 10 Movies and TV Player, you must
add HEVC support to the player.

Both Premiere Pro and CyberLink PowerDirector 17 can handle HEVC.

The bitrate is reduced to 32Mbps. I'm hoping that due to the use of 
HEVC, the quality will be comparable to 56Mpbs with H.264.

I plan to submit the plug-in to the [RICOH THETA Plug-in Store](https://pluginstore.theta360.com/).
Look for "Long Video HEVC".

If you are are compiling from source, follow these steps for installation:

1. install plug-in with adb
2. set permissions with Vysor
3. use the THETA Desktop app to set the default plug-in "Long 4K Video"

## Usage

1. put camera into plug-in mode
2. take video
3. stop plug-in by pressing lower mode button
4. turn camera off by pressing the power button for 8 seconds
5. turn camera back on and plug into your computer with a USB cable
6. look for the file in /RICOH THETA V/Fixed Storage/DCIM/100RICOH

## Post Production

### Spatial Media Metadata Injector

You may need to inject the metadata into the video file
with [Spatial Media Metadata Injector](https://github.com/google/spatial-media/releases).

Install the binary file with the link above. Pre-built applications are available for Mac and Windows.

Open the file.

Save the file with metadata injected with a new filename. Use the new video file
with injected metadata in your applications and on YouTube/Facebook.

Both Premiere Pro and PowerDirector support HEVC 360Â° video editing.

## Sharing Videos

After injecting the metadata, you can upload the HEVC file to YouTube directly.

## Limitations

* No spatial audio. The code can be modified to save a 4ch spatial audio .wav file with first-order ambisonics B-format. 
The spatial audio file is not saved by default to avoid people having to delete the file.
